# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation was to challenge to complete this study guide the feeling a accomplishment.I built this project because I wanted to make a study guide website that would help organize the prework required for the bootcamp. I simplified the prework by implementing HTM, CSS, and JavaScript into the file. I also utilized github and gitbash to combine all the coding languages into one file. During the JavaScript portion I debugged coding issues to make the study guide work. I learned an introduction to the coding languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As well as how to use Github to combine branches of code.

Provide instructions and examples for use. The prework study guide can be used to look at notes that provide information about each of the four categories: HTML, CSS, JavaSript, and Git. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
